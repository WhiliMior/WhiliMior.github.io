Penguin UK, 2016. I would like to combine this week’s reading and the important psychoanalytic theory of the Other with the basic position I stated last week. Sans the tedious theoretical elaboration of the Mirror Stage, the conclusion is simple: one subject can only see himself from the Others’ eyes. In the world of postcolonial capitalism, it is difficult to debate the place of an atomized subject in the world. Both definitions of womanhood and of the East inevitably fall into essentialism, which is an extremely complex issue, as Said draws out in her essay. Questions like “what is a woman” and “what is East Asia” inevitably involve discourse and cultural oppression. Next, I would like to ask a question that has haunted me for a long time: are the triggers behind cyber-postmodernism and neoliberalism irreconcilable contradictions inherited from the above-mentioned post-colonialism? To illustrate, Cyber-postmodernism is a widespread and frequent phenomenon. Its purpose is to negate, and it negates to negate. Postmodernist art denies everything, just like the bananas taped to the wall in that art gallery. Yet its very existence is impotent; it cannot truly negate anything, but instead becomes an abstract and purely hedonistic pleasure. The intention is to express “cultural tolerance” in films, novels, etc., but the means used is to encapsulate post-colonial ideology into these cultural expressions, is it really inclusive? For example, the depiction of Wakanda in the movie Black Panther and the depiction of Chinese cultural identity in Shang-Chi. Even the very existence of the concept of Captain America is a result of the aftermath of post-colonialism. If I were to go into detail, Wakanda, a fictional nation with an extremely high level of technology, chooses its supreme leader through a deadly force duel. This far-fetched and chaotic description is precisely postmodernism’s attempt to reconcile the contradictions left behind by post-colonialism. And this phenomenon, itself, is the result of Orientalism ideology. All attempts at so-called cultural inclusion and equality within a colonialist perspective are inherently contradictory. This culture sees the human being as something inhuman, as a polymer of some impure concept. The resistance to postcolonialism is not simply to distinguish between the I and the Other, but to essentially abolish the I and the Other, while of course retaining the specific attributes of both sides. Marx’s classic statement, articulated in Theses On Feuerbach, is clear enough: “man…is the ensemble of the social relations”. Against the typical discriminatory works of culture such as The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, the human being, any human being, is treated as a purely individual person. There is no difference between you and me, we are all human beings first and foremost. But how does that work, and can it really work? Or am I dreaming? I myself don’t know exactly where the left’s path leads. Failed, all of it.

Sexes and Genealogies. 1993. pg9-21. Very interesting article. The very act of the author questioning the legality of phallus is an act of patricide. The topic of contraception and abortion was a highly controversial subject in the United States of America in the 1980’s and to this day. In China, however, abortion has not been a taboo since ancient times. The Han Book, written in 105 A.D., records the use of medication for abortion by the ancient Chinese. I have to admit that I have a hard time understanding why the political situation in the United States and the social ideology under the influence of Christianity is against abortion. But I was able to understand the article’s linking of the power of phallus to the dilemmas faced by women, especially regarding the right to abortion. Even in ancient China, where abortion was allowed (and especially in the imperial palace where it would even be promoted), the position of women and the exploitation and oppression they suffered was there for all to see. The physical toll this all takes on women is undeniable. However, I am a Lacanian psychoanalyst, and as I read the article, I realized that the psychoanalytic approach mentioned in the article differed so much from the Lacanian school of thought that I had studied. For example, the article argues that most biological males possess the phallus, whereas in Lacan’s theory, no one possesses the phallus, and that man or woman is simply the result of the discipline of the symbolic order, as Lacan said, “Woman does not exist”! Neither man nor woman can possess the phallus, so as the diagram below shows, man is blindly pursuing the constitutive exception of the primitive father (obsessive-compulsive), while woman has no desire to be the primitive father (hysterical). And a man is a man only because he wants to be a primitive father, which arguably has nothing to do with whether he has a biological penis or not. Even this position of male and female can be interchanged through dialectics. I can cite this with the most classic storytelling strategy and the most failed art form: the movie. In Antigone, Antigone is a female character. Of course, if the author writes her female she has to be. But whether she’s female or not contributes nothing to the progression of the story. Or rather, the most important thing for the march of the story is the character’s motivation in reaction to the events happening in the setting. For example, we can go on to analyze whether Antigone represents feminity or not. yes, but not exactly. We can say that some of Antigone’s behaviors are even masculine, pure toxic masculinity and that the so-called male mind and female mind are just tensions for the playwright, two tensions in one body, and the common force of these two tensions is the character’s motivation. Cinema, its very existence is a paradox. Cinema wants to express what is beyond them through the pure language of cinema, which encompasses the visual and the auditory. In other words, cinema’s attempts in the past few decades have been to use film as a medium and film language as a semiotic structure to capture something beyond semiotics. For example, let’s say that animated films are full of critters with sex characteristics that humans can recognize visually. This is paradoxical because as a director or writer, you have to choose a person as your protagonist. That person has to be a biologically existing individual. This even goes so far as to explain why Disney and Pixar both had to make their critters look like a certain gender when they made their animated movies. This purely ideological indoctrination just proves the lack of film as a medium. Perhaps animated films are not a complete case of cinema; we might consider Robocop and Artificial Intelligence (Spielberg), two robot movies. Why do robots have to be in human form, and why do they have to exhibit some sort of gender identity? Because the very thing of gender is paradoxical enoug","date":"2023-12-05","objectID":"/posts/9ac6a2d/:0:0","tags":["Psychoanalysis"],"title":"Mysterious Feminism, A Hysterical Writing","uri":"/posts/9ac6a2d/"},{"categories":["Research Paper"],"content":"Shannon Li Avital Ronell GERM-UA 244 Nov. 23rd, 2023 ","date":"2023-11-23","objectID":"/posts/baaad8c/:0:0","tags":["Psychoanalysis","Film"],"title":"Standing Over the Glass Bridge Above the World's Rift","uri":"/posts/baaad8c/"},{"categories":["Research Paper"],"content":"Standing Over the Glass Bridge Above the World’s Rift\rFor psychopharmaceuticals, positivist psychology categorizes them: anxiolytics, empathogens, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens. and these drugs, which are always chemically and electronically interfering with the brain’s natural way of functioning. The user of a drug usually expects a specific drug to work. Users of drugs usually expect that a particular drug will bring about a particular effect that will change the mental dilemma they are currently experiencing. This paper will combine psychotropic drugs and postmodernist writing to explore whether the world of hallucinations Walter Benjamin refers to is actually a gift from mother Nature. In Hashish in Marseilles, Benjamin describes what he sees after smoking marijuana. The reality of everything is veiled in a veil of fantasy. What is most noticeable is his motivation for smoking marijuana: pleasure: “My walking stick begins to give me a special pleasure” (118). Although he hesitates for a long time, when he does try it, he gets excellent feedback. Admittedly, he did get good results. Because he wanted pleasure, marijuana brought him pleasure. But there is an extremely dangerous passage here: the pleasure obtained by using hallucinogens always comes in the form of fantasy. And the presence of fantasy must be supported by unconsciousness, which has no possibility of creating fantasy with anything other than language; fantasy must be decomposable by consciousness. In Jacques Lacan’s Seminar 14: The Logic of Fantasy, he argues against Descartes’s congito and proposes a model that depicts four different situations. Specifically in the fifth part of his seminar on the subject. I am, I think I am, I think I am not, I think I am, I don’t think I am not, I don’t think For fantasy, it is not that the subject is thinking, but that the subject is not thinking. Unconscious subject is structured like a language, and the subject discovers that the request to the big Other cannot be fulfilled, and thus further discovers Object petit a. This is because Object a, as an absence, is always at the very center of desire. that is always at the very center of desire. The subject desires Object a, but it is always out of reach. Desire can be fulfilled, and desire will always continue to arise. object a will always manifest itself in other forms. And it is in this way that the subject, through the inaccessibility of Object a, recognizes and feels again and again the original emasculation that once took place in the Imaginary register. By entering the language, the subject is emasculated, and must accept the absence of Object a. And precisely, Object a in the Symbolic register is the constitutive exception of the subject. We can demonstrate here, through the dialectic of desire, that Object a is not absent, but exists in the form of absence. The quest for Object a is precisely because Object a is desired to exist. If there were no lack, the subject would not desire something. The thinker is not the subject, but rather the unconsciousness. The ground of the unconsciousness is the unthinking consciousness, the directly identified perceptions of the human being that have not yet been symbolized. The four relations of Being to Thinking mentioned above are in fact the four relations between the unconscious subject and Object a in Lacan’s sense. And there is an intersection between “je ne pense pas” and “je ne suis pas”, where there is a missing phallus in the Imaginary register. representation, we can call it -φ.

Plato: Complete Works. Hackett Publishing, 1997. Phaedrus. On my first day of seventh grade (freshman year of junior high school), I had a very childish argument with a kid wearing glasses about a stupid question. The main form of this argument was as follows: You’re stupid. Bounce back! Bounce is not valid! The rebound is valid, period! My IQ is twice yours, comma! My IQ is your absolute value! Of course, we could go on and on with this rhetorical question. However, when I first heard the concept of “absolute value,” I realized I couldn’t continue the argument. The reason was that I didn’t know what “absolute value” was, i.e., I had no signified in my head, and my whole language system went down for a few seconds. Perhaps in retrospect, we could have stacked that argument with concepts like “squaring,” but that would have implied some kind of rhetorical rift. This essay is about the dialog between Socrates and Phaedrus, but for ease of communication, I will refer to Socrates’ view as Plato’s view. Plato believes that discussing the concept of love should ensure that both participants in the discussion have an equal understanding of it. But this is obviously not possible, as no two people have the exact same experience. The love Plato discusses in the dialogues takes three different forms: love motivated by profit, love driven by sexual desire, and pure and divine love. But none of them expresses the concept of “love” in its entirety. If I were to argue with my seventh-grade eyeglasses about the others, the essence would be the same as the forms described by Plato in his essay. We could open an argument about the largest number, as Sanskrit Buddhists have done for the last thousand years. Gangā-Nadī-Vālukā = 10^52 Asaṃkhyeya = 10^140 Nayutaḥ = 10^37 Nirabhilapya nirabhilapya Parivarta = 10^(7×2^122 ) It doesn’t really matter how big these numbers are, but rather the fact that they were all created to expound on the length of time that the Buddha experienced. And the authors always felt that the existing number designations were not big enough, so they had to invent a bigger number. And it is not enough just to use these numbers, it is even more important to emphasize them repeatedly. In a sentence, large numerical designations are always placed on top of each other for multiplication. “A nirabhilapya parivarta times a nirabhilapya parivarta is an ineffably ineffable [nirabhilapya nirabhilapya]. A nirabhilapya nirabhilapya times a nirabhilapya nirabhilapya is a nirabhilapya nirabhilapya parivarta” (Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment, Fascicle 45, Chpt. 30). Not to mention that the entirety of that article is non-stop creating large numbers by squaring stacks. I’m certainly intrigued that Plato wants to discuss rhetoric here and that he mentions the limits of rhetoric: apparently reading through a dictionary doesn’t mean that one has learned everything. Memorizing an entire medical work does not mean one can practice medicine. “It is their ignorance that makes them think they have discovered what rhetoric is when they have mastered only what it is necessary to learn as preliminaries” (546). In addition to this, Plato also explains the relationship between writing and memory through the story of an Egyptian god on page 551. Plato argues that what is written down in books is not the wisdom of the human brain. I would be willing to provide another ridiculous punchline for your pleasure for a while: “The bigger the fish, the more spines it has; the more spines it has, the less flesh it has; the less flesh it has, the smaller it is. So the bigger the fish, the smaller the fish.” “The greater the rate of surplus value, the greater the surplus value. The more surplus value, the less necessary labor. The less necessary labor, the less variable capital. The less variable capital, the higher the organic composition of capital. The higher the organic composition of capital, the smaller the rate of profit.

He always appears as an inviolable figure. In the story of Oedipus, no matter how hard Oedipus and his own parents try, the prophecies of the gods are always fulfilled. This great burden is present in the form of fate. Oedipus comes to Tiresias to explain who is the contamination, and because Tiresias points out that Oedipus is the contamination, the two begin to quarrel over who is the “blind” (370-410). This reminds me of Lacan’s reference in a seminar of The Purloined Letter to three different kinds of people: “blind, seer and robber”; blind does not see, seer knows that blind does not see and pretends not to see, and robber sees what lies beneath the surface. Blind can’t see, seer knows blind can’t see and pretends he can’t see, and robber sees what lies beneath the surface. Rather, for the Oedipus story, fate, oracles, and so on participate in the writing of Oedipus’ tragedy in the form of a signifier. For Oedipus, his fate is precisely the process by which he becomes phallus. His blindness also means precisely that the floating signifier rules his nonconscious. Joel Dor mentions an example of compulsion in Chapter 16 of his book Clinical Lacan. A man fantasizes about being caressed by a female nurse in a hospital. And such compulsion is caused by the child’s being aware of his mother’s absence as a libido projection object of his mother at an early age. Rather, I think that the highly paradoxical notion of “fate” plays a paternal role in Oedipus’ story. It is not so much that Oedipus identifies with Laius as with the Oedipus of destiny, and his constant refusal to become the prophetic self in turn recognizes the decisive role of prophecy as the name of father. Nietzsche’s “god is dead” does not imply the corruption of order and morality, but rather that if order and morality are thought to exist for god, it proves that god is not dead. In other words, all of Oedipus’ resistance against fate and prophecy presupposes the recognition of the existence of prophecy. It is for this reason that prophecy cannot be resisted precisely because it presents itself in the compulsive rejection of Oedipus. phallus presents as absent. In this way, the name of the father manifests itself: the opposition to the father is precisely the desire for incest. is the agitation for the semiotic order. emphasizes its own importance, while making Oedipus constantly phallus. I have always had an aversion to our upcoming tests (and the various memorizations of “years and titles”), almost a compulsive rejection (or a manifestation of it). I didn’t like the format of the tests and had a hard time getting good grades on them. Admittedly this has to do with my trauma of not being able to get good grades as a poor student in middle school. Such a compulsive rejection makes it nearly impossible for me to properly memorize “pure”. As a result, it is extremely difficult to remember the name of a new friend, the spelling of a name, or the year of an event. I don’t think it’s that I lack the ability to do this, it’s just that my nonconscious stops me from doing it. This makes my symptoms manifest as a kind of fetishism for words, rather than a rejection of symbols, which is itself a manifestation similar to that of Oedipus. Just as Oedipus blinded himself with his mother Jocasta’s brooch after her death, he refuses to face trauma. He refuses to come to terms with trauma, with all the evil he has done. Yet this is what the university as an ideological machine must necessarily become, and this is why all university professors have to become phallus (knowledge). We have to enter into such a bizarre system of capital transactions in order to show that our own credits prove to be of such exploitative value in the midst of the domestication of capitalism. University discourse necessarily serves as an authority that makes all the constituents within its apparatus its agents.

The story is about an extremely complex family drama and an isolated island murder case, and contains quite a lot of hardcore logical reasoning. One extremely important concept in that game is magic. Magic is the key to reasoning in the game, i.e. the purpose of the reasoning is that the existence of magic needs to be disproved in order to find the truth about the secret murder case. The focus of this paper is not to market the video game, but to explore the limits of semiotics as well as hermeneutics in terms of its concept of magic and the narrative devices that contain it. In the narrative structure in Umineko, author Ryukishi07 depicts a murder on an island. That is, a bizarre case in which all the people on the island died. The author rewrites the case many times throughout the work, i.e., he repeatedly narrates the case with different endings many times, but never informs the reader of the truth of what happened on the island in the work. The author also introduces the concept of magic several times, and witches and magic appear frequently in the story. Magic, however, is a tool used to hide the truth of the case in their narrative. In Episode 8, the author presents a short story. A mother quietly slips candy into her child’s pocket, and later tells the child that it was the witch who gifted the candy. The purpose of magic here is to conceal, but the truth itself is not altered. Whether the mother tells the child that it was the witch who gave the candy or whether the mother herself bought the candy for the child, the child gets the candy in the result. But why does it have to be magic, and why does the mother gift the child with candy through the mouth of the witch? In Edgar Allan Poe’s short story The Purloined Letter, the author describes a short story. The minister took one of the queen’s letters in a dignified manner and placed it in the most conspicuous place in the whole room, causing the police to search his whole house and still not find the letter. If this story is viewed in a simple means, it can be corresponded with the game of hide and seek like. In hide-and-seek, both sides of the game are in a state of prisoner’s dilemma. They must continually go through a cycle of deducing their own ideas being seen through by the other and their own seeing through the other’s seeing through their own ideas. For example, in the first level of deduction, the policeman thinks that the minister will hide the letter. The minister naturally comes to the second level, i.e., the minister knows that the police know that the minister will hide the letter, so the minister does not hide it. Dupin, on the other hand, is at the third level, and Dupin is aware of the minister’s prejudgment, so Dupin thinks that the minister is not hiding the letter. This cycle is described as “blind” and “sees” in the Intersubjectivity chapter of Jacque Lacan’s Seminar. One of the three subjects is blind, the second knows that the first is blind and pretends not to see it. The third, on the other hand, realizes that this hiding is essentially exposure, and Lacan refers to these three identities as “blind, seer and robber” (Müller 60). If we return to Umineko’s short story, it can have another variation. A child playing at home accidentally breaks an expensive vase and becomes very frightened. Suddenly, a witch appears, who waves her wand and fixes the vase. And after the witch leaves, one of the witch’s mischievous black cats rushes over and knocks over the vase, and the vase breaks again. The ending of the vase being broken doesn’t change in this story. Instead, it’s just that when the mother comes back and sees the crying child and asks the child what happened, the child tells the mother the story about the witch and the black cat.

A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia. Hackett Publishing, 2011. Astrology had a very important place in the theoretical system of these ancient philosophers. Their philosophical ideas, however, were in a state of infantile speculation about natural phenomena during the period of human civilization’s exploration of the unknown. Although it is said that the three Milesians were wrong about the world because basic chemistry and physics were not developed at that time, and even mathematics was in an embryonic stage. But that does not mean that there is nothing to learn from their ideas. For example, say, in subsection 15 on page 18, Hippolytus discusses the physical properties of the earth and the sun, that is, using the physical laws he summarizes for the earth to make derivations for astronomy. Frankly I really didn’t get his point in this paragraph, perhaps because my basic knowledge as a modern human being hardly allows me to visualize the astronomical principles he describes. I think it’s irrelevant to dwell on whether their knowledge of physics was factually incorrect at all. Why did they form such ideas, why did they think the world consisted of certain elements, why did they think there was some kind of primordial matter (perhaps the same inertia of thought that led to the formulation of the atomic theory or even the theory of the Higgs boson)? What mode of thinking guided them? Philosophy, from its ancient Greek etymology, is love Sophia, the love of wisdom. Here is the phrase: “Men who are lovers of wisdom must be inquirers into many things indeed” (36, p. 45). It is not that the study of philosophy brings one any didactic ability, eloquent speech or anything (indeed, many people say this about philosophy students). Nor do I think that studying philosophy makes one overman, understand everything, become enlightened. Love to Sophia is about embracing a mode of thinking, a spirit of inquiry. And this spirit is common to the research attitude of positivist science. The study of philosophy necessarily requires the researcher to constantly inquire, to explore. In the constant movement of theories, let theories spiral upward. I don’t expect a big Other to suddenly jump out and tell me what the truth of the world is, or that it simply doesn’t matter whether truth exists or not. In the chapter on Parmenides, there is a quote that runs through Western philosophy, \" . . . for the same thing is for thinking and for being\" (3, p. 58). From this, I would argue, the entire lineage of philosophical history up to the post-Critique of Pure Reason era is threaded with this thought. It is (if I may paraphrase) something more than Platonist Idealism, and what it says about the sameness of the two, thinking and being, does not mean that we always have to look to the dichotomy of subject and object. Rather, fundamentally they are the same thing, not two. And the great thing about this statement is that it is necessarily uttered by thinking. Or whether it is uttered by thinking or by being, the latter becomes the former. The process has proven itself. Beautiful thinking. In paragraph 3 on page 102, Anaxagoras brings up the discussion of the small and the large. It reminds me of Heraclitus’ words on page 45, paragraph 40: “It is not possible to step twice into the same river”. It touches on the dialectical approach in a metaphysical way. Was thinking about pure formal logic really the secret of the ancient philosophers?

It can be a conflict between natural law and man-made law, or a conflict between a positivist position and a non-positivist position on the same legal case. Antigone, in jurisprudential terms, stands for natural law, and Creon stands for man-made law. It seems that the story simply discusses the importance of natural law (morality). It seems to be a confrontation between morality and law. But Antigone’s story has a certain sublime value in it. The characters in the story have a very unusual emphasis on the definition of womanhood. It’s like if I do something weak, if I give in, I become a woman. If I am strong, if I legislate, then I am a man, as Creon puts it: “Contemptible character, inferior to a woman” (73)! Creon considers a vile character to be an expression of a woman, and he himself, as a man, naturally spurns such behavior. And Ismene similarly says: “we must remember that we are women, who cannot fight against men” (11). Of course, for historical reasons, Sophocles lived in an Athenian slave-owning democracy, where the right to “democracy” was only open to a small number of adult males. But why was this so? Women’s suffrage was not widely discussed and utilized until the 19th century. Something was at work here. Was it female sexuality? For Antigone, she represented precisely a certain beauty, a certain sublime beauty. as to whether women and female sexuality existed at all, that in itself is questionable. Ismene had counseled Antigone against the impulsive behavior that had cost her her life. But Antigone, in her own compulsive repetition, must do it, must do it compulsively. For if she agrees, she becomes one of the products of the ideological narrative. Only when she compulsively says “No!” she becomes a subject. But why? This compulsion is based on some pure contingency. For example, Kant’s high categorical imperative compels her to obey morality, but this abstract morality is fundamentally untenable, and Antigone says that it doesn’t matter if her husband dies or her children die. Because one can remarry and reproduce (87). But her brother as a unique signifier, so no. So let us consider who is more unique between the brother and the father and the son? Antigone’s explanation is fundamentally so absurd that it is the most absurd grasp of pure chance. And it is precisely in this way that she becomes the opening of subjectivity in the world. For Lacan, Antigone’s behavior is precisely a compulsion, a complete, insistent compulsion to fantasize. She believes that the big Other is absent. But is that really the case? Rather, her symptoms become the penetrating force that connects the three Registers. In Jacques Lacan’s Seminar VII, he analyzes Antigone’s constant assertion that “I chose death” is an embodiment of the death drive. If Antigone is defending her brother’s right to be buried on the basis of “absolute disinterestedness”, what order of things obliges her to do so? It is in fact her own action. She does not act for the sake of others, but as the subject of her desire, she acts with complete autonomy. Otherwise, her resistance would have been violently placed as a vulgar disrespect for her true action. For she simply does not believe in a total, underpinning semiotic order, and to recognize the existence of the sublime is to deny Antigone’s resistance. Lacan, too, does not deny the existence of Others, and in his Seminar XI he even says: “Man’s desire is the desire of the Other”. However, Antigone’s true action is precisely what Lacan means by traverse the fantasy, because she is ready to face the cruel fundamental fantasy. As for Creon, it is better to say that he is the one most controlled by the order. He did not set the law at all, but the law demanded that he set the law itself. Antigone, who always talks about Zeus, does not seem to recognize the presence of the gods, and Slavoj Žižek, in his book Enjoy Your Symptom!, even suggests one of Antigone’s pur","date":"2023-09-18","objectID":"/posts/9fbbf41/:0:0","tags":["Literature","Psychoanalysis"],"title":"Antigone","uri":"/posts/9fbbf41/"},{"categories":["Prose"],"content":"This is a speech I made for the class Classical Literature \u0026 Philosophy with prof. Emanuela Bianchi. In the first class, our professor wrote guidelines for our oral presentation and told us that we need to kick off the class discussion with a thought-provoking question at the end, but to avoid overly broad questions such as “So what do you all think? I then wondered if the question was really that broad. But I finally decided to use this question as the centerpiece of the discussion, and my presentation would inevitably end the class discussion with this question. Even if my motivation at the outset was resistance to the father’s injunctions - anti-Oedipus on a Freudian level. In fact, the more dogma there is about the father’s injunctions, the more the idea of the child rebelling against the dogma is created. Jacques Lacan’s conception of Law is almost exclusively related to desire; Law commands the subject to “enjoy as little as possible”! But the dialectic between Law and desire emerges: Desire is to transgress, to transgress prohibition (Seminar VII). And meanwhile, there is another pleasure of being prohibited. A very, academic naming for masochism. So, back to our topic. The first thing I would like to discuss is hermeneutics, a term originally derived from the Greek myth of Hermes, the messenger of the gods, whose duty it was to deliver the words of the gods to the earth. He then necessarily needed to interpret the words of the gods. That’s why we need a question session, where the speaker asks, “Any questions, or what do you all think”? In the millennia that followed, hermeneutics served as a separate discipline for interpreting Scripture, as Augustine explained, where God communicates with believers through the sign of Scripture. In the days of the Reformation, Protestants had attacked the Catholic interpretation of Scripture by hermeneutics. As you can see, there can be so much dispute about the true meaning of the exact same text - but whether there is such a transcendent thing as true meaning is uncertain. Nietzsche had his own opinion about antiquities. Those antiquities are so far removed from us that we cannot find in everything that has become history any relevance for our modern life. But when we try to find the meaning in antiquity, we begin to ask questions. We reconstruct it in the arrogant words of our vision. What is mine? All these things are so far from me. How are the trivialities going to pull me into their reality? When I am confronted with the mountains of antiquities, I marvel at their richness and complexity. So I can’t help but ask, I want to speak directly with the great Plato, Socrates. To talk to them at length. I kept on asking questions, asking questions, asking all the questions I encountered in my limited knowledge and hoping for some answers. And so, as I read antiquity. Questions, I couldn’t pull away to keep me from asking questions. Now, let us consider the question. For example, when Parmenides asked the question of being, he asked, “Being is, non-being is not.” It’s very understandable, but why is non-being not? When we ask the question, the question becomes the answer. We go and consider why non-being is not present, we go and consider why nothing is not present. You can feel that something is lacking in it. Being is, but why? Non-being is not, but why? Parmenides did not ask these two questions, but merely made a statement, he said these two statements. But we will inquire, and ask why this is so and why not. The answer to this question is secondary to the realization that there is a problem here. In this way, the statement, and the question, become one in a sort of dialectic. They are both presuppositions of some kind. To say that Being is, for example, non-being is not, is a statement that does not explain why. We would then go and ask questions with Parmenides, saying why being is, why non-being is not. And subsequently, we would realize the problem in the questions we ask.

If it is because of personal experiences and other reasons that I choose to accept certain ideas and reject certain things. Then me, I’m always in denial. From the time I started making choices, I refused to accept them, but I was never able to reject the act of choosing itself. I could see my refusal quite clearly, but I was also refusing to accept my own disgusting refusal. The changes, always many, were great. Maybe something happened that caused some cracks to appear in my world. I used to doubt the real, the existential, because I was unwilling to accept that broken present world. I asked, how do I save you, how do I save you in this broken world, and the only response I got was silence. The only response I got was silence. So I started to think, starting with the activity of that childish thought, and I tried to discover the hue of that world. everything was so unreal. I remembered my memories, I remembered my experiences, I remembered the white brick walls, the green fake grass - they were just as vibrant in winter. Who was sharing with me in that empty world? Maybe I am overthinking, or maybe I am too selfish, and I am always unable to feel the truth of the Other, the emotions of the Other, the love of the Other. So I choose to reject it? Is this my choice? Do I say that the colors of the world have fallen off so much because of my terrible trauma that I can no longer see all hope? Yet I want to see hope, and I always have hope. I say, why is it always me in my writing, why is it always myself in my thoughts. Did I ever make myself hard-hearted because I didn’t want to believe in my own weakness, or was it an attempt to escape from the colorful world? Behold the colors of the world. Behold the sound of the world. It’s not that I don’t see the world emerging, it’s my closure that prevents me from embracing it. Why? Why, to reject it? It is not that the world possesses a rift, but my heart possesses a rift. I am divided, and I myself cannot see my own most sincere words. Who else do you want to deceive? I’m sorry, but I can’t do it, I don’t have the capacity, I don’t have the ability to accept, to believe, to embrace. I say, it’s okay, I want you to live. Alive, what is it? Maybe just surviving, even if it’s under a dome of bleakness again. No, it’s not, I say. I say you can lose everything, you can lose everything you have, anything, but you have to have one thing. You must have it, a zest for life. It’s not a suggestion, it’s a requirement, a necessity. Rejection, coldness. Whatever word goes to describe it, it doesn’t matter. Because the color of the world does not come from the world, I am the world. It is easier said than done, and how difficult it is. I try everything, I try everything I can do. There is a limit to my power. I keep on, keep on, trying to find the answer in a higher body of knowledge. There is no answer. Perhaps colors do not hide themselves, or perhaps they have long since laid themselves bare in their most atrocious form. But what I see, I do not see them, I see myself. I see my dead body rotting in the fields. No! Don’t do this. I don’t want you to leave. But I’m sorry that I can never give you what you want. O passionate life, it has never denied me. I just, can’t be near you. Why! Is it because I rejected it? Where exactly is the color, what exactly is it. No, it’s not, it’s not. I want everything of you. I want to be alive. The color did not fall off, the color never left me. And I have never rejected you, rejected your colors. Am I worthy? Do not ask questions! Do not doubt! Take action, take action! Passion is not some need, but a necessity. Are you pushing me? No, I’m sorry, I regret saying that. Oh, the clouds, the clouds floating softly in the blue sky. What a beautiful day. So I stopped.

The dead are stranded on the “Beach” and become the living dead called BTs. When BTs consume the living, it will trigger a “voidout” similar to a nuclear explosion. In addition, a rainwater called timefall makes the infrastructure of the passage of time accelerated, so that they quickly collapse. The player takes on the role of Sam Porter Bridges, who is responsible for delivering supplies to the isolated colonies and reconnecting them with wireless networks. The “Seam” is a place between the living and the Beach, allowing him to travel between the world of the living and the Beach. I will start from this game to deconstruct what Death Stranding is trying to tell us. At the beginning, I would like to discuss “object”. By object, are they real, mechanical substances? What is the matter in the so-called “materialism” as described by German philosopher Karl Marx? In Death Stranding, the player takes on the role of Sam, as a courier, reconnecting the entire United States. So, why does it have to be a courier? In the real world of 2019, a worldwide virus called Covid-19 has emerged. This virus, because of its severity, has forced many countries and regions to block communication with the outside world. Covid-19 made human contact extremely miserable, as public transportation and a lot of infrastructure were shut down due to the effects of the virus. As Karl Marx mentioned in his article Theses On Feuerbach, “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it. The point is to change it.” No matter how one tries to deconstruct the metaphysical symbols, the final question must lead to an end: what to eat tonight. For life itself, it is true beyond all criticism. But not in a mechanical, rigid way of being. Rather, life itself, by nature, reveals itself in its most authentic form. In this way, it is neither transcendent nor mysterious. Rather, it is naked and necessary. The courier is not a profession that is often touched upon in literary works. Yet, for concrete human labor, the logistics system is fundamental to the exchange of all metaphysical values. It must be the courier, because for the inevitability of life itself, all thinking is stripped of its veneer in front of it, and their scarcity is nakedly displayed. What to eat tonight, the reality of such a problem eventually became a heavy punch that knocked people down. Because the material and real world does not change by human will, this also seems to make all our thinking meaningless. There is a serious conflict within this absurd reality and the philosophical thinking about what to eat tonight, because not eating leads to death. No matter how much philosophers deconstruct the explanation of the world, in the end the only real problem remains, and that is “death”. Why death? How does our existence touch death in the midst of such a real, tangible life? In fact, death is not the antithesis of existence. And, modern death is long and common. In an article discussing modernity in 2022, I mention that modern people are dead. “Not because of our physical flaws, but because we live in a breeding ground of over- completeness” (Li, Modernity 16). Modern people are dead in a world of signs and simulacra because they are no longer able to make any subversive impact on existing constructs. In Death Stranding, the Internet, thanks to timefall and BT, can no longer support the task of connecting the world. The touch that was once close at hand is now out of reach. It is just like yesterday for you and me who have experienced Covid-19. In the current reality, this sense of distance and brokenness is exactly what Death Stranding wants to express. In terms of intuition, this kind of death is always in contact with us. The most direct manifestation of this is food advertising. With food commercials, it is always straightforward to whet people’s appetite.

Now excuse me, I have to go” (Kon). These were the last words Kon Satoshi wrote on his deathbed. In May 2010, he went to the hospital due to physical discomfort and was found to have pancreatic cancer. In August of the same year, Kon Satoshi passed away at the age of 46 (Loo). He is a famous Japanese animation director who only directed six works in his lifetime. The last work Dream Machine was never finished because of his death. As he said in his last words, he always respects his artistic process and appreciates the team that helped him. He regrets that he can no longer finish work that was halfway done. Although the number of works is not large, he has truly achieved that every film is a rich stroke in film history. Each of his works has won many international awards and has been studied and imitated by later directors of various countries. Different from Miyazaki’s warmth and Shinkai’s freshness, Kon Satoshi is keen to describe the pressures faced by urbanites in modern society and explore the connection between reality and fantasy. The plots of his films are is mostly based on dreams. Imaginative fantasy, magical editing, and nuanced details constitute his unforgettable personal style. Watching his films often brings a unique experience of wandering between reality and the dream. Kon Satoshi is a dream maker, as Kon Satoshi’s autobiography Kon’s Tone described himself. One of Kon Satoshi’s most magnificent works, Paprika, also talks about “dream” directly from “dream”. So, there is nothing wrong with interpreting Kon Satoshi’s creations from a dream perspective. Perfect Blue is the first film directed by Kon Satoshi. To most people, this is not only Kon Satoshi’s debut work but a work that establishes his style and shows his genius. It can be said that the debut is the peak. The film is a story about the transformation of an idol singer into an actor. The protagonist, Mima, is a member of a J-pop group. She leaves the group and becomes an actress. But not all her fans are happy with this decision, which caused her to be being threatened and tracked by some crazy fans. After shooting a scene that Mima plays as a victim of rape, she becomes jumpy and can no longer distinguish reality and her actress life. Which is a sign of dissociative disorder. And after she becomes psycho, most of the actors, cameramen, writers in the rape scene get murdered. In fact, it is her agent, an actress who once failed, who is jealous of her beauty and success and wants to become Mima. That is the reason the agent killed the actors who raped Mima in the film. Perfect Blue is an animated film that combines suspense, thriller, and fantasy. The atmosphere of suspense and horror haunts the mind all the time, making the audience unable to guess what will happen in the next second, and can only get increasingly into it. The climax and the ending are even more striking. Fantasy and reality are depicted so close to each other. Perfect Blue is a film about anxiety. Mima starts her collapse from the first time she left her comfort zone. The path of an actress is unknown and fully covered under the shadow. The pressure of the new job, questions, and disappointment of her fans, creates anxiety. Moreover, being an idol is an exposure of her personal. While the story happens in the age when the Internet just spread out, televisions, cameras, websites are all the extensions of the eyes. Therefore, Mima’s life is under Gaze. The relation between lookers and being looked at is multidimensional. Because not only her fans are looking, her movie fans, collaborators, everyone who pays attention to her, and even us, the audience of the movie Perfect Blue, have become her lookers. Mima is being placed under spotlights and cameras, under Gaze. These Gazes are the reason for anxiety, which is a feeling of unpleasure, danger.

But how did they die? I have done a lot of theoretical analysis in the article, but I think the theory is not enough for people’s material life. As Karl Marx mentioned in his article Theses On Feuerbach, “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.” I think my artistic creation is a practice of philosophical theory that changes the world. What I want to show is the process of a person dying. Not biological death, but internal, active, loss of the ability to live. The artwork I want to make is a short film, and I’ll be the writer, director, and multiple handymen that don’t need to be subdivided. It focuses on the life of a delivery man. It tells the story of the protagonist from having a dream of changing the world, and then falling into a forbidden love. Then to sexual inversion, and disciplined cynics. Until the protagonist completely gave up all dreams and died. This may seem a bit abstract. If we describe it in a familiar way, it should be: an unemployed vagabond who dreams of a better life becomes a deliveryman and falls in love with a prostitute. Of course, as a lot of directors I love, they kill prostitutes, and of course I wanted to learn how by imitating. Following the story will continue: He brings food to her everyday, with his own coins. But in one day’s delivery, he finds abnormal screams and fighting noises comes out of her room. He dreams about being a hero and saves her, beats the bad guy, and free her from sex work. But he does nothing. He stands in front of the door, untill there is no sound inside. Then he leaves, while the murderer holds a knife looks at him from the peephole. Next day, the police calls him. Inform him that she is dead. The idea for this story took shape a long time ago. I’m a huge fan of the Ghost in the Shell series, and I first got my hands on it about seven years ago. In its second TV series, S.A.C. 2nd GIG, there is an episode titled Night Cruise. In a cyberpunk world depicted by Ghost in the Shell, portray the image of a driver. The refugee problem caused by the global local war, as well as the ethical problem in the context of prosthetic transformation - it happened that the driver had participated in the war at the same time and experienced full-body mechanization. He gradually felt that he was being cut out of society. He was dissatisfied with the work environment that was not respected by his boss, and fantasized about killing his boss by deliberately causing a car accident while driving (10:00-12:00). But he didn’t do anything, he just fantasized. I think I was deeply influenced by the work’s bold assumptions about world politics and the description of the existence of a highly developed capitalist society. Every small change in the world can be huge when projected on one of its people. I have to appreciate the influence Ghost in the Shell had on my art style when I was younger. The shattering of dreams, just like the trauma of falling into the Real Register after the shattering of Object a, is one of the processes in which modern people die. We constantly fantasize and then fall into but in such a postmodern society, all semiotic language has an overwhelming gravity. It forces us to face a world where desire is lost, and symbols are fragmented. How powerless we are in the face of it that we have to die. Until we get used to the feeling of surviving in chaos and can no longer be reborn. Poor sinking. Regarding the thinking behind this story, I think I myself am as sad as the protagonist. I am a Marxist artist, all my practice is an extension of the theory, and all my theories are for the people. Because practice is the only criterion for testing truth. But if there are people here who care as much as I do about the well-being of the people, the sad truth is that we have actually failed. The Left Revolution, like the delivery man, is alive but dead.

His writing always presents a disgusting world where we feel be apart from ourselves - As how we feel in modern times. In his work, The Silence of the Sirens, he used five hundred words to tell a simple story: “To protect himself from the Sirens Ulysses stopped his ears with wax and had himself bound to the mast of his ship” (Kafka). When Ulysses traveled into the sea where the Sirens are, he heard nothing. He saw “their throats rising and falling, their breasts lifting, their eyes filled with tears, their lips half-parted”, and believed they are singing something. But sirens sang nothing, only silence. It seems like a simple story of Ulysses plugging his ears to prevent himself from being seduced by sirens. It’s just that Kafka has added a layer of skin to it, that is, sirens themselves do not sing. But this leads to another question that Kafka discussed in the last paragraph, that is, can Ulysses know that sirens didn’t sing, or did he start thinking about the possibility that sirens didn’t sing? This is a bold rewrite of the story in Homer’s The Odyssey. Specifically, what Kafka expresses is actually what Ulysses loses in rejection. In the story, Ulysses can no longer prove that sirens didn’t sing. If we make a bolder generalization, we should say that modern people are Ulysses. We all lose something in rejection. The sirens-like silence conveyed by Kafka is, instead, a powerful resistance. But before resisting, we should see Ulysses’ rejection, and his cynicism disciplined by modernity. The so-called modernity refers to a structure under the discourse of modern society. For example, the life of modern people cannot be separated from the construction of factories, currencies, the Internet, and other infrastructure. Strictly speaking, modernity does not have such a concrete representation of reality. However, the social phenomenon manifested by modern life itself has modernity. If we look at another dimension of modern life, the most appropriate example should be the Internet. Specifically, it should be a semiotic transmission mode under the discourse power of capitalism - but modernity does not only exist in capitalism, what is emphasized here is the modernity constructed by the capitalist discourse. Since smartphones and the Internet entered millions of households ten years ago, there has been a scary social phenomenon: people seem to have gradually lost their ability to criticize, or the question of if people lost their ability to think under the influence of big data is being more and more asked. So, what exactly is modernity? What kind of predicament have people stepped into under the discipline of modernity? Let’s start with the conclusion: Modern men are dead. Modern men have lost the ability to perceive and reflect, so we are dead. We can no longer cause any substantial disruption to any existing architecture, but simply go with the flow. We are no longer part of history, but modern data at the end of history. How so? How do modern people die? We need to start with how modernity affects people. Modernity is a dissolution of tradition, which can lead to a terrifying sense of rupture. Because when people no longer have the ability to perceive tradition or pre-modernity. Modernity has become the only tradition. Traditional traditions are dismantled and replaced by unconventional traditions. From Michel Foucault’s point of view, modernity is the process of rule building, which imbues life with unconventional order and procedures. Michel Foucault is a representative of 20th-century French philosophy, and his research on power and the control of modernity is collected in his book Discipline and Punish. Foucault mainly discusses how the prison - as an object of modernity’s mode of punishment - came into being. The death of modern people is carried out in prisons, but not a physical one.

Western developed countries led by the United States began to enter the consumer society one after another. In Asia, Japan has gone through the most prosperous 1980s in its reflections on wars. At the same time, both South Korea and China have entered a stage of rapid economic development. At this stage, the fatal crisis of capitalism in the era of heavy industry and colonialism was hidden by the economic climax, while at the same time it was exploiting the humanity more covertly. From the post-war era until the arrival of the 21st century, consumer capitalism has always been hidden under the beauty of economic development, affecting the daily lives of Asian people. Consumerism, in essence, is a powerful variant of capitalism and a manifestation of capitalism-it promises all happiness and beauty in the form of fetishism to maintain and suppress the inherent contradictions and crises of capitalism. The consumer society is destined to be the best habitat for advertising. One of the main characteristics of the consumer era is ubiquitous advertising. And one of the essences of advertising is consumerism, which is to encourage consumption, stimulate consumption, and lead and even create consumer demand. Consumerism in Asia in the 1980s took a ride on technological development. In the context of the technological explosion, the spread of symbols depends on emerging media. Advertisements are spread more widely through emerging technologies such as VRC, radio, and television. The distinguishing feature of the era of mass culture is the dramatic increase in symbols. Especially the dramatic increase in image symbols, and “visualization” has been placed in a prominent position. We live in a symbolic empire. The statement that advertising is the “king” of this symbolic empire is a bit exaggerated, but it does not falsely show the prominent position of advertising in the current society. The current society is that advertising is everywhere, where “encountering” various advertisements is one of the daily experiences that modern people are familiar with. The American communication professor Sut Jhally described in his book Image-Based Culture the current situation of society being filled with information. “In the contemporary world, messages about goods are all pervasive-advertising has increasingly filled up the spaces of our daily existence. Our media are dominated by advertising images, public space has been taken over by ‘information’ about products, and most of our sporting and cultural events are accompanied by the name of a corporate sponsor” (Jhally 200). In the world he described, advertisements are flooded within people’s symbol systems. Sut Jhally explained the process of using symbols to represent products to engage the media then output into information. The symbolic language of daily life is squeezed by advertisements. In this squeezing process, advertising sells not only products but also a consumer social order that is universally involved and cannot be circumvented or not allowed to be circumvented. Because advertising cannot be avoided. Advertising manages the needs of consumers. It teaches people what to expect from consuming every item. In other words, it tells people what each object gives them, or an object gives them what kind of results will it bring. Andrew C. McKevitt is introducing Sony’s attempt to promote Betamax in 1985. Betamax is a VCR that can record video on tape in a portable way. “A brief paragraph beneath the image explained in simple language just what the Betamax did—what, when, how, and how long it recorded. The ads finished by evoking the image of empowerment: ‘You’re always stuck watching what the networks want Why not watch what you want instead’” (McKevitt 138)? In the example given by Andrew C.

The photo was taken from the outside of the walled city, a commercial street composed of buildings. In the lower part of the photo, which is the part of the commercial street accessible to pedestrians, there are many billboards written in Chinese. Below these dense billboards, there are shuttle pedestrians. It is worth noting that on the edge of the road, a large amount of rubbish is piled up disorderly and no one cleans it. In the upper part of the photo, there is a residential area made up of windowsills like cages. The whole photo has a strong taste of Hong Kong streets. And this kind of dense, even artistic architectural complex structure. This special architectural composition is one of the most artistically valuable in the Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong. This photo was taken by Greg Girard between 1986 to 1992. He simply titled this photo gallery Kowloon Walled City (Girard). Behind the photo, what he expresses is the real life of Kowloon Walled City, its special composition method and the unique history produced by history. This photo directly shows the rubbish on the ground caused by the lack of management and infrastructure construction in the Walled City, and this photo is only a corner of the exterior of the Kowloon Walled City. Inside the Kowloon Walled City, chaotic alleys, irregular three-dimensional building structures, and dark and narrow living spaces reflect the special nature of this area. Living in the Kowloon Walled City is not something to look forward to. As Greg Girard introduced in his book City of Darkness Revisited, there is a lack of drinking water supply inside the walled city, power shortage, and small living space (Girard). But what is strange is that the existence of the Kowloon Walled City and its special way of existence make artists try their best to reproduce this architectural style. As Derek Mead introduced in the article A New Look at Kowloon Walled City, the Internet’s Favorite Cyberpunk Slum. The most well-known art style that represent Kowloon Walled City is Cyberpunk. And the writer who firstly introduced this type of visual impact to the public by novel is an American Sci-fi writer, William Gibson. William Gibson saw Greg Girard’s photo during his trip in Japan. This directly stimulated William Gibson’s subsequent writing. His famous work Neuromancer visually reproduces the Kowloon Walled City (Mead). In the decades that followed, Kowloon Walled City became an excellent form of cyberpunk. Aside from other derivative works, just this photo of Greg Girard is enough to show the beauty of the structure of the Kowloon Walled City. Why is such a place not worth living in so attractive, so that people continue to reproduce in the works of art? What is it about the chaotic architectural complex with a very low quality of life like The Kowloon Walled City that makes it repeatedly drawn in the modern era of continuous technological and economic development? What is the aesthetic significance of Kowloon Walled City in art? The special construction of Kowloon Walled City is a special result formed in a special historical process. The colonization of the British Empire controlled Hong Kong, which the Qing Dynasty could not govern, but the Qing government tried its best to retain the administrative power of the Kowloon area. Unfortunately, the collapse of the Qing government is already a matter of time. As Derek Mead concluded about the history of this city, next to the crumbling Qing government, Kowloon has become an extra-legal place surrounded by high walls and no one is willing to take responsibility (Mead). Due to the lack of jurisdiction, Kowloon Walled City has become an excellent place for refugees from the World War II (Mead). They finally formed a residential area spontaneously, which is also the preface for the Kowloon Walled City to grow into a complex of bu","date":"2021-11-29","objectID":"/posts/89debba/:1:0","tags":["Aesthetics","Cyberpunk","Architecture"],"title":"The Aesthetic Value and Construction of the Kowloon Walled City","uri":"/posts/89debba/"},{"categories":["Research Paper"],"content":"Work Cited\rGirard, Greg.
