      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Aeschylus. &lt;em&gt;The Persians&lt;/em&gt;. Prentice Hall, 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gruen, Erich S. “Rethinking the Other in Antiquity.” &lt;em&gt;Princeton University Press eBooks&lt;/em&gt;, 2010, &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400836550&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400836550&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Said, Edward W. &lt;em&gt;Orientalism: Western Conceptions of the Orient&lt;/em&gt;. Penguin UK, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to combine this week&amp;rsquo;s reading and the important psychoanalytic theory of the Other with the basic position I stated last week. Sans the tedious theoretical elaboration of the Mirror Stage, the conclusion is simple: one subject can only see himself from the Others&amp;rsquo; eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the world of postcolonial capitalism, it is difficult to debate the place of an atomized subject in the world. Both definitions of womanhood and of the East inevitably fall into essentialism, which is an extremely complex issue, as Said draws out in her essay. Questions like &amp;ldquo;what is a woman&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;what is East Asia&amp;rdquo; inevitably involve discourse and cultural oppression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, I would like to ask a question that has haunted me for a long time: are the triggers behind cyber-postmodernism and neoliberalism irreconcilable contradictions inherited from the above-mentioned post-colonialism? To illustrate, Cyber-postmodernism is a widespread and frequent phenomenon. Its purpose is to negate, and it negates to negate. Postmodernist art denies everything, just like the bananas taped to the wall in that art gallery. Yet its very existence is impotent; it cannot truly negate anything, but instead becomes an abstract and purely hedonistic pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The intention is to express &amp;ldquo;cultural tolerance&amp;rdquo; in films, novels, etc., but the means used is to encapsulate post-colonial ideology into these cultural expressions, is it really inclusive? For example, the depiction of Wakanda in the movie &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; and the depiction of Chinese cultural identity in &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt;. Even the very existence of the concept of Captain America is a result of the aftermath of post-colonialism. If I were to go into detail, Wakanda, a fictional nation with an extremely high level of technology, chooses its supreme leader through a deadly force duel. This far-fetched and chaotic description is precisely postmodernism&amp;rsquo;s attempt to reconcile the contradictions left behind by post-colonialism. And this phenomenon, itself, is the result of Orientalism ideology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All attempts at so-called cultural inclusion and equality within a colonialist perspective are inherently contradictory. This culture sees the human being as something inhuman, as a polymer of some impure concept. The resistance to postcolonialism is not simply to distinguish between the I and the Other, but to essentially abolish the I and the Other, while of course retaining the specific attributes of both sides. Marx&amp;rsquo;s classic statement, articulated in &lt;em&gt;Theses On Feuerbach&lt;/em&gt;, is clear enough: &amp;ldquo;man&amp;hellip;is the ensemble of the social relations&amp;rdquo;. Against the typical discriminatory works of culture such as &lt;em&gt;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&lt;/em&gt;, the human being, any human being, is treated as a purely individual person. There is no difference between you and me, we are all human beings first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But how does that work, and can it really work? Or am I dreaming? I myself don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly where the left&amp;rsquo;s path leads. Failed, all of it.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Mysterious Feminism, A Hysterical Writing</title>

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Irigaray, Luce. &lt;em&gt;Sexes and Genealogies&lt;/em&gt;. 1993. pg9-21.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very interesting article. The very act of the author questioning the legality of phallus is an act of patricide. The topic of contraception and abortion was a highly controversial subject in the United States of America in the 1980&amp;rsquo;s and to this day. In China, however, abortion has not been a taboo since ancient times. The Han Book, written in 105 A.D., records the use of medication for abortion by the ancient Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I have a hard time understanding why the political situation in the United States and the social ideology under the influence of Christianity is against abortion. But I was able to understand the article&amp;rsquo;s linking of the power of phallus to the dilemmas faced by women, especially regarding the right to abortion. Even in ancient China, where abortion was allowed (and especially in the imperial palace where it would even be promoted), the position of women and the exploitation and oppression they suffered was there for all to see. The physical toll this all takes on women is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I am a Lacanian psychoanalyst, and as I read the article, I realized that the psychoanalytic approach mentioned in the article differed so much from the Lacanian school of thought that I had studied. For example, the article argues that most biological males possess the phallus, whereas in Lacan&amp;rsquo;s theory, no one possesses the phallus, and that man or woman is simply the result of the discipline of the symbolic order, as Lacan said, &amp;ldquo;Woman does not exist”! Neither man nor woman can possess the phallus, so as the diagram below shows, man is blindly pursuing the constitutive exception of the primitive father (obsessive-compulsive), while woman has no desire to be the primitive father (hysterical). And a man is a man only because he wants to be a primitive father, which arguably has nothing to do with whether he has a biological penis or not. Even this position of male and female can be interchanged through dialectics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.lacanonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/not-all-not-one.png&#34; alt=&#34;Not All&#34; srcset=&#34;https://www.lacanonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/not-all-not-one.png?size=small, https://www.lacanonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/not-all-not-one.png?size=medium 1.5x, https://www.lacanonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/not-all-not-one.png?size=large 2x&#34; data-title=&#34;Not All&#34; style=&#34;background: url(/images/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;&#34; onload=&#34;this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of [&#39;style&#39;, &#39;data-title&#39;,&#39;onerror&#39;,&#39;onload&#39;]){this.removeAttribute(i);}this.dataset.lazyloaded=&#39;&#39;;&#34; onerror=&#34;this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of [&#39;style&#39;, &#39;data-title&#39;,&#39;onerror&#39;,&#39;onload&#39;]){this.removeAttribute(i);}&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can cite this with the most classic storytelling strategy and the most failed art form: the movie. In Antigone, Antigone is a female character. Of course, if the author writes her female she has to be. But whether she&amp;rsquo;s female or not contributes nothing to the progression of the story. Or rather, the most important thing for the march of the story is the character&amp;rsquo;s motivation in reaction to the events happening in the setting. For example, we can go on to analyze whether Antigone represents feminity or not. yes, but not exactly. We can say that some of Antigone&amp;rsquo;s behaviors are even masculine, pure toxic masculinity and that the so-called male mind and female mind are just tensions for the playwright, two tensions in one body, and the common force of these two tensions is the character&amp;rsquo;s motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cinema, its very existence is a paradox. Cinema wants to express what is beyond them through the pure language of cinema, which encompasses the visual and the auditory. In other words, cinema&amp;rsquo;s attempts in the past few decades have been to use film as a medium and film language as a semiotic structure to capture something beyond semiotics. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say that animated films are full of critters with sex characteristics that humans can recognize visually. This is paradoxical because as a director or writer, you have to choose a person as your protagonist. That person has to be a biologically existing individual. This even goes so far as to explain why Disney and Pixar both had to make their critters look like a certain gender when they made their animated movies. This purely ideological indoctrination just proves the lack of film as a medium. Perhaps animated films are not a complete case of cinema; we might consider &lt;em&gt;Robocop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; (Spielberg), two robot movies. Why do robots have to be in human form, and why do they have to exhibit some sort of gender identity? Because the very thing of gender is paradoxical enough; its very existence is a pure contingency that constitutes a sexual exception. There is no way to imagine an individual who is outside of both genders, so much so that all LGBT symbolic imagery is essentially a splintering of this paradoxical construct. Even more horrifying is the brutal misuse of women to promote a conformist ethic. For example, the use of female actors in a playwright&amp;rsquo;s carefully crafted success story of a female entrepreneur. Can we call it liberating? No matter how we answer, the question itself is unanswerable. If we answer yes, it is liberating. The reason for this is simply that it shows the unexpected success of the female figure in a place where she would not otherwise have ventured. If we say no, it is not liberating. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it rather suggest that this kind of movie already posits the female figure within a male chauvinist ideological structure? Because it is only in a male chauvinist narrative that we say that women should not be successful in their careers. And no matter how we answer that we default to the dominance of a male chauvinist ideology. You realize that this is a dead end, this is a dead end that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to make my point clear. I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting that biological feminism, as referenced in this book, is an ideology that has negative implications in terms of value judgments. On the contrary, I think the idea is on the positive side, it&amp;rsquo;s just that the author walked into a rut. She didn&amp;rsquo;t pull herself out of this dichotomy which is silly enough on its own. If it is men who oppress women, then turning women into men will not change the status quo in any way. The oppression is always there, it&amp;rsquo;s just reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychoanalysis has been concerned with the body since Freud. All the theories are derived from the interactions and feedback that people carry out in the physical world. This is why the dilemma faced by the female body cannot be ignored. However, this physical predicament is in fact rooted in a semiotic mechanism that is more ethereal than physical, and I prefer to attribute the exploitation of the female body to the appropriation and privatization of the means of production. The class contradiction here manifests itself as a gendered contradiction. As Shulamith Firestone makes a startling leap in her &lt;em&gt;The Dialectic of Sex&lt;/em&gt;: so-called fertility is essentially a means of production. The action of the gender struggle, then, should be framed in terms of the class struggle. &amp;ldquo;so the end goal of the feminist revolution must be, unlike that of the first feminist movement, not just the elimination of male privilege but of the sex distinction itself&amp;rdquo; (Firestone, chpt. 1). I think I agree with Firestone&amp;rsquo;s position and point of view. Instead of tinkering with the broken symbolic order in an environment that is not radically revolutionary, why not just mash up the symbolic order?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point I need to make here is that capitalism and masculinity are both the same at their core. Even male oppression under feudalism is all about the appropriation of reproductive rights, the appropriation of the means of production. And it is important to note here that oppression does not only exist between men and women, class oppression exists between bourgeoisie and proletariats. If we look closely at ordinary people going about their ordinary lives in the world, we will see that oppression is never practiced by all men against all women. It is practiced by all the bourgeoisie against all proletariats. To eliminate class is to eliminate the concept of gender itself. And only by doing so can we free the males who are controlled by primitive fathers, and free the females who are controlled by the compulsions of males as well. Who exactly is your enemy and who is your friend? Don&amp;rsquo;t I think feminists should unite all the forces they can? Dividing the masses will only weaken the revolution.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

The user of a drug usually expects a specific drug to work. Users of drugs usually expect that a particular drug will bring about a particular effect that will change the mental dilemma they are currently experiencing. This paper will combine psychotropic drugs and postmodernist writing to explore whether the world of hallucinations Walter Benjamin refers to is actually a gift from mother Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hashish in Marseilles&lt;/em&gt;, Benjamin describes what he sees after smoking marijuana. The reality of everything is veiled in a veil of fantasy. What is most noticeable is his motivation for smoking marijuana: pleasure: &amp;ldquo;My walking stick begins to give me a special pleasure&amp;rdquo; (118). Although he hesitates for a long time, when he does try it, he gets excellent feedback. Admittedly, he did get good results. Because he wanted pleasure, marijuana brought him pleasure. But there is an extremely dangerous passage here: the pleasure obtained by using hallucinogens always comes in the form of fantasy. And the presence of fantasy must be supported by unconsciousness, which has no possibility of creating fantasy with anything other than language; fantasy must be decomposable by consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Jacques Lacan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Seminar 14: The Logic of Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, he argues against Descartes&amp;rsquo;s congito and proposes a model that depicts four different situations. Specifically in the fifth part of his seminar on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am, I think&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am, I think&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am not, I think&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am, I don&amp;rsquo;t think&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am not, I don&amp;rsquo;t think&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For fantasy, it is not that the subject is thinking, but that the subject is not thinking. Unconscious subject is structured like a language, and the subject discovers that the request to the big Other cannot be fulfilled, and thus further discovers Object petit a. This is because Object a, as an absence, is always at the very center of desire. that is always at the very center of desire. The subject desires Object a, but it is always out of reach. Desire can be fulfilled, and desire will always continue to arise. object a will always manifest itself in other forms. And it is in this way that the subject, through the inaccessibility of Object a, recognizes and feels again and again the original emasculation that once took place in the Imaginary register. By entering the language, the subject is emasculated, and must accept the absence of Object a. And precisely, Object a in the Symbolic register is the constitutive exception of the subject. We can demonstrate here, through the dialectic of desire, that Object a is not absent, but exists in the form of absence. The quest for Object a is precisely because Object a is desired to exist. If there were no lack, the subject would not desire something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thinker is not the subject, but rather the unconsciousness. The ground of the unconsciousness is the unthinking consciousness, the directly identified perceptions of the human being that have not yet been symbolized. The four relations of Being to Thinking mentioned above are in fact the four relations between the unconscious subject and Object a in Lacan&amp;rsquo;s sense. And there is an intersection between &amp;ldquo;je ne pense pas&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;je ne suis pas&amp;rdquo;, where there is a missing phallus in the Imaginary register. representation, we can call it -φ. Something has been sent away that has understood that something is missing, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand what it is missing, so it is -φ. This is precisely what Heidegger means by Dasein. unthinking consciousness, the most superficial consciousness. The perceptions with which one directly identifies. &amp;ldquo;From the beneficial dialectic to which there was offered in advance total order, absolute knowledge, and which is called the Dasein &amp;quot; (part 22). This chaotic, egoless state, close to the community of mother and child, is precisely the pre-linguistic one, before the mirror stage. And this state is where the hallucinogens are constantly trying to get to. And here, precisely, is the place that Benjamin depicts as the place to which Mother Nature constantly throws people: &amp;ldquo;she now throws us, without hoping or expecting anything, in ample handfuls toward existence &amp;quot; (126).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Returning to Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s hallucination journey, we can then see that hallucination is the structure of the neurosis subject. Through fantasy, the subject fantasizes about giving his -φ to the big Other. through a fantasy frame the Object a fantastically ceases to be lost. This is where marijuana and all the hallucinogens act as a master signifier. The subject can then enter the signifier chain through his fantasized phallus in order to produce some figurative object of desire. But the figurative desire object is bound to fail because Object a is originally lost. In Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s original text, he refers to the morning after smoking marijuana: &amp;ldquo;What one writes down the following day is more than an enumeration of impressions&amp;rdquo; (Benjamin 122). Here, Benjamin describes a pre-linguistic dream, one that cannot be interpreted. And precisely this is the repressed desire. The unconsciousness has only one purpose, the fulfillment of repressed desires. And so Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s description speaks of a pure desire: to escape. Escape from the Symbolic order, from the real world bound by the signifier, to a beautiful fairyland filled with hallucinations, as Benjamin writes in the end: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;hashish persuades Nature to permit us-for less egoistic purposes-that squandering of our own existence that we know in love&amp;rdquo; (126). As mentioned earlier, the purpose of hallucination is to arrive at a chaotic pre-linguistic world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On October 13, 2023, a 25-minute long animated pilot episode entitled &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Digital Circus&lt;/em&gt; was pushed to YouTube. Its plot follows the protagonist as he travels into an electronic circus in a computer and is unable to return to the real world. At the end of the story, the protagonist, Pomni, after a hopelessly failed escape attempt, finally comes to terms with reality in an expression that cannot be described in words on paper.

Glitch Productions, &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Digital Circus Pomni at Dinner&lt;/em&gt;, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an extremely typical postmodernist work. It uses the comedy of the absurd to describe the experience of a person who faces the lack of the Real head-on. There are many other works of art created based on a certain desire: &lt;em&gt;Backroom, SCP, Liminal Space, Cores&lt;/em&gt; including &lt;em&gt;Weirdcore, Dreamcore&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Traumacore&lt;/em&gt;. With the exception of &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Digital Circus&lt;/em&gt;, all of these works of art have one irreplaceable characteristic: they are the result of the co-creation of the same narrative core by the general public. These works can only be created in the 21st century because they are dependent on the highly developed electronic communication network. And it is precisely this phenomenon that manifests a certain postmodern fantasy: a communal dream world that exists only in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s marijuana use was an attempt to return to the good fairyland, the birth of those aforementioned cultural works was itself an attempt to create an electronic fairyland. And the fantasies, because of this, are completely unconscious attempts. These fantasies, including &lt;em&gt;Digital Circus&lt;/em&gt;, are about spaces of some kind. And these spaces, often in the form of an abstract and fragmented narrative, are chaotically edited into a video with serene music. In Walter Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s other book, &lt;em&gt;One-Way Street&lt;/em&gt;, he describes a kind of ruin &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Seville, Alcazar&lt;/em&gt;.-An architecture that follows fantasy It is undetected by practical considerations. These rooms provide only for dreams and festivities-their consumption. Here dance and silence become the leitmotifs, since all human movement is absorbed by the soundless tumult of the ornament&amp;rdquo; (Travel Souvenirs). This kind of ruin is precisely how perfectly it interprets the way those spaces exist. Pairing the subject with the object, and the traveler has to be absorbed by those ruins. Most of the above-mentioned works of cyberculture can be referred to as ruins. Ruins, a kind of shattered, once-human existence of a building. Ruins are always associated with people, but they do not neatly map the prosperity they once enjoyed when they were rightfully intact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When people engage in public, crowded fantasies by constructing such communal dreamscapes, it is surprising that people appreciate brokenness. Yet it is not so much the brokenness that one admires, but the prosperity. Through the ruins one sees prosperity. One fantasizes about the luxury and enjoyment of that ruin when it is intact. This is the nostalgia of the postmodern network, and if we look back at Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s marijuana, we can see a hint of it. &amp;ldquo;Versailles, for one who has taken hashish, is not too large, or eternity too long&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;I feel this humor infinitely when I am told at the Restaurant Basso that the kitchen has just been closed, while I have just sat down to feast into eternity&amp;rdquo; (119). If that psychedelic vision of lost time, that hallucination that distorts the notion of space and time, could keep me forever in this most beautiful fairyland, then I could escape from the Real for eternity; it is the Real that is so violent that one has to flee to the hallucination. This is the most postmodern aspect of &lt;em&gt;Digital Circus&lt;/em&gt;: it is not that people want to escape from the virtual and return to the real, but that they want to escape from the real and come to the virtual. Through a completely opposite narrative, &lt;em&gt;Digital Circus&lt;/em&gt; succeeds in reconfiguring the world in terms of what Benjamin describes as humor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s combine those public cyber-illusions with the hallucination Benjamin describes, and we are able to get a postmodernist dilemma: there is nowhere to escape. As the theme of &lt;em&gt;Digital Circus&lt;/em&gt; suggests, the protagonist, Pomni, is constantly trying to escape from a place from which she has no possibility of escaping in the foreseeable future. Even for marijuana smokers, in the end, one still has to go back to that sad reality to eat the meal set out on the plate. This, precisely, is the aforementioned -φ, an absent imaginary phallus. the subject, emasculated by language and symbolic order, loses all ability to really make any material difference to all lack, and is only able to masturbate in front of a darkened computer in the basement in front of an illuminating consumer sex product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-cited&#34; class=&#34;heading-element&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Work Cited&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;#work-cited&#34; class=&#34;heading-mark&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;svg class=&#34;octicon octicon-link&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 16 16&#34; version=&#34;1.1&#34; width=&#34;16&#34; height=&#34;16&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS: PILOT.” &lt;em&gt;Youtube&lt;/em&gt;, uploaded by Glitch, 13 Oct. 2023, youtu.be/HwAPLk_sQ3w?si=t7HJONNTQicHH4Ax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin, Walter. &lt;em&gt;On Hashish.&lt;/em&gt; Translated by Howard Eiland, The Belknap Press of Harvard UP, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;. &lt;em&gt;One-Way Street&lt;/em&gt;.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Plato. &lt;em&gt;Plato: Complete Works&lt;/em&gt;. Hackett Publishing, 1997. &lt;em&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On my first day of seventh grade (freshman year of junior high school), I had a very childish argument with a kid wearing glasses about a stupid question. The main form of this argument was as follows:&#xA;You&amp;rsquo;re stupid.&#xA;Bounce back!&#xA;Bounce is not valid!&#xA;The rebound is valid, period!&#xA;My IQ is twice yours, comma!&#xA;My IQ is your absolute value!&#xA;Of course, we could go on and on with this rhetorical question. However, when I first heard the concept of &amp;ldquo;absolute value,&amp;rdquo; I realized I couldn&amp;rsquo;t continue the argument. The reason was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what &amp;ldquo;absolute value&amp;rdquo; was, i.e., I had no signified in my head, and my whole language system went down for a few seconds. Perhaps in retrospect, we could have stacked that argument with concepts like &amp;ldquo;squaring,&amp;rdquo; but that would have implied some kind of rhetorical rift.&#xA;This essay is about the dialog between Socrates and Phaedrus, but for ease of communication, I will refer to Socrates&amp;rsquo; view as Plato&amp;rsquo;s view.&#xA;Plato believes that discussing the concept of love should ensure that both participants in the discussion have an equal understanding of it. But this is obviously not possible, as no two people have the exact same experience. The love Plato discusses in the dialogues takes three different forms: love motivated by profit, love driven by sexual desire, and pure and divine love. But none of them expresses the concept of &amp;ldquo;love&amp;rdquo; in its entirety.&#xA;If I were to argue with my seventh-grade eyeglasses about the others, the essence would be the same as the forms described by Plato in his essay. We could open an argument about the largest number, as Sanskrit Buddhists have done for the last thousand years.&#xA;Gangā-Nadī-Vālukā = 10^52&#xA;Asaṃkhyeya = 10^140&#xA;Nayutaḥ = 10^37&#xA;Nirabhilapya nirabhilapya Parivarta = 10^(7×2^122 )&#xA;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter how big these numbers are, but rather the fact that they were all created to expound on the length of time that the Buddha experienced. And the authors always felt that the existing number designations were not big enough, so they had to invent a bigger number. And it is not enough just to use these numbers, it is even more important to emphasize them repeatedly. In a sentence, large numerical designations are always placed on top of each other for multiplication. &amp;ldquo;A nirabhilapya parivarta times a nirabhilapya parivarta is an ineffably ineffable [nirabhilapya nirabhilapya]. A nirabhilapya nirabhilapya times a nirabhilapya nirabhilapya is a nirabhilapya nirabhilapya parivarta&amp;rdquo; (Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment, Fascicle 45, Chpt. 30). Not to mention that the entirety of that article is non-stop creating large numbers by squaring stacks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m certainly intrigued that Plato wants to discuss rhetoric here and that he mentions the limits of rhetoric: apparently reading through a dictionary doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that one has learned everything. Memorizing an entire medical work does not mean one can practice medicine. &amp;ldquo;It is their ignorance that makes them think they have discovered what rhetoric is when they have mastered only what it is necessary to learn as preliminaries&amp;rdquo; (546). In addition to this, Plato also explains the relationship between writing and memory through the story of an Egyptian god on page 551. Plato argues that what is written down in books is not the wisdom of the human brain. I would be willing to provide another ridiculous punchline for your pleasure for a while:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The bigger the fish, the more spines it has; the more spines it has, the less flesh it has; the less flesh it has, the smaller it is. So the bigger the fish, the smaller the fish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The greater the rate of surplus value, the greater the surplus value. The more surplus value, the less necessary labor. The less necessary labor, the less variable capital. The less variable capital, the higher the organic composition of capital. The higher the organic composition of capital, the smaller the rate of profit. So the greater the rate of surplus value, the smaller the rate of profit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is of course a logical fallacy, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. After all, all logic depends on the metaphysical structure of language. For example, we can see if we can write it this way:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The more knowledge you have, the more literate you are. The more literate you are, the more you read. The more you read, the more you take notes. The more notes you take, the less you memorize. The less you memorize, the less you know. So the more knowledge you have, the less knowledge you have.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, then, the act of studying &amp;ldquo;what is the definition of this word&amp;rdquo; obviously does not make a student a philosopher. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to doubt that. Is it really so? There are times when I do feel that perhaps a dictionary explaining all philosophical terms is necessary, and there are times when I feel that a dictionary should never be allowed. I am not conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <title>Oedipus</title>

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In Sophocles&amp;rsquo; stories, God is always an extremely important object. He always appears as an inviolable figure. In the story of Oedipus, no matter how hard Oedipus and his own parents try, the prophecies of the gods are always fulfilled. This great burden is present in the form of fate.&#xA;Oedipus comes to Tiresias to explain who is the contamination, and because Tiresias points out that Oedipus is the contamination, the two begin to quarrel over who is the &amp;ldquo;blind&amp;rdquo; (370-410). This reminds me of Lacan&amp;rsquo;s reference in a seminar of The Purloined Letter to three different kinds of people: &amp;ldquo;blind, seer and robber&amp;rdquo;; blind does not see, seer knows that blind does not see and pretends not to see, and robber sees what lies beneath the surface. Blind can&amp;rsquo;t see, seer knows blind can&amp;rsquo;t see and pretends he can&amp;rsquo;t see, and robber sees what lies beneath the surface.&#xA;Rather, for the Oedipus story, fate, oracles, and so on participate in the writing of Oedipus&amp;rsquo; tragedy in the form of a signifier. For Oedipus, his fate is precisely the process by which he becomes phallus. His blindness also means precisely that the floating signifier rules his nonconscious.&#xA;Joel Dor mentions an example of compulsion in Chapter 16 of his book Clinical Lacan. A man fantasizes about being caressed by a female nurse in a hospital. And such compulsion is caused by the child&amp;rsquo;s being aware of his mother&amp;rsquo;s absence as a libido projection object of his mother at an early age.&#xA;Rather, I think that the highly paradoxical notion of &amp;ldquo;fate&amp;rdquo; plays a paternal role in Oedipus&amp;rsquo; story. It is not so much that Oedipus identifies with Laius as with the Oedipus of destiny, and his constant refusal to become the prophetic self in turn recognizes the decisive role of prophecy as the name of father.&#xA;Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;god is dead&amp;rdquo; does not imply the corruption of order and morality, but rather that if order and morality are thought to exist for god, it proves that god is not dead. In other words, all of Oedipus&amp;rsquo; resistance against fate and prophecy presupposes the recognition of the existence of prophecy. It is for this reason that prophecy cannot be resisted precisely because it presents itself in the compulsive rejection of Oedipus. phallus presents as absent.&#xA;In this way, the name of the father manifests itself: the opposition to the father is precisely the desire for incest. is the agitation for the semiotic order. emphasizes its own importance, while making Oedipus constantly phallus.&#xA;I have always had an aversion to our upcoming tests (and the various memorizations of &amp;ldquo;years and titles&amp;rdquo;), almost a compulsive rejection (or a manifestation of it). I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the format of the tests and had a hard time getting good grades on them. Admittedly this has to do with my trauma of not being able to get good grades as a poor student in middle school. Such a compulsive rejection makes it nearly impossible for me to properly memorize &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;As a result, it is extremely difficult to remember the name of a new friend, the spelling of a name, or the year of an event. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s that I lack the ability to do this, it&amp;rsquo;s just that my nonconscious stops me from doing it. This makes my symptoms manifest as a kind of fetishism for words, rather than a rejection of symbols, which is itself a manifestation similar to that of Oedipus. Just as Oedipus blinded himself with his mother Jocasta&amp;rsquo;s brooch after her death, he refuses to face trauma. He refuses to come to terms with trauma, with all the evil he has done.&#xA;Yet this is what the university as an ideological machine must necessarily become, and this is why all university professors have to become phallus (knowledge). We have to enter into such a bizarre system of capital transactions in order to show that our own credits prove to be of such exploitative value in the midst of the domestication of capitalism. University discourse necessarily serves as an authority that makes all the constituents within its apparatus its agents.&#xA;In the story of Oedipus, then, we can see that Oedipus tries to break the command of the superego, while the university discourse tries to maintain the command of the superego, to make the subject subservient to the authority of knowledge, and that Sphinx, as a kind of intellectual authority, is challenged to death by Oedipus. However, Oedipus instead becomes a monarch again. In this way, it would be better to say that even if Oedipus did not kill, he essentially challenged the semiotic order and then became some kind of order. he had to do that, it was his superego&amp;rsquo;s order.&#xA;I have to recognize that Oedipus himself, as a character who opposes the semiotic order, is bound to fail. This has to do not only with the writing style of the Sophocles period but also precisely with the father&amp;rsquo;s taboo. Even if he does succeed in opposing his fate, fate is still present, as Nietzsche comments.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

The story is about an extremely complex family drama and an isolated island murder case, and contains quite a lot of hardcore logical reasoning. One extremely important concept in that game is magic. Magic is the key to reasoning in the game, i.e. the purpose of the reasoning is that the existence of magic needs to be disproved in order to find the truth about the secret murder case. The focus of this paper is not to market the video game, but to explore the limits of semiotics as well as hermeneutics in terms of its concept of magic and the narrative devices that contain it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the narrative structure in &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;, author Ryukishi07 depicts a murder on an island. That is, a bizarre case in which all the people on the island died. The author rewrites the case many times throughout the work, i.e., he repeatedly narrates the case with different endings many times, but never informs the reader of the truth of what happened on the island in the work. The author also introduces the concept of magic several times, and witches and magic appear frequently in the story. Magic, however, is a tool used to hide the truth of the case in their narrative. In Episode 8, the author presents a short story. A mother quietly slips candy into her child&amp;rsquo;s pocket, and later tells the child that it was the witch who gifted the candy. The purpose of magic here is to conceal, but the truth itself is not altered. Whether the mother tells the child that it was the witch who gave the candy or whether the mother herself bought the candy for the child, the child gets the candy in the result. But why does it have to be magic, and why does the mother gift the child with candy through the mouth of the witch?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Edgar Allan Poe&amp;rsquo;s short story &lt;em&gt;The Purloined Letter&lt;/em&gt;, the author describes a short story. The minister took one of the queen&amp;rsquo;s letters in a dignified manner and placed it in the most conspicuous place in the whole room, causing the police to search his whole house and still not find the letter. If this story is viewed in a simple means, it can be corresponded with the game of hide and seek like. In hide-and-seek, both sides of the game are in a state of prisoner&amp;rsquo;s dilemma. They must continually go through a cycle of deducing their own ideas being seen through by the other and their own seeing through the other&amp;rsquo;s seeing through their own ideas. For example, in the first level of deduction, the policeman thinks that the minister will hide the letter. The minister naturally comes to the second level, i.e., the minister knows that the police know that the minister will hide the letter, so the minister does not hide it. Dupin, on the other hand, is at the third level, and Dupin is aware of the minister&amp;rsquo;s prejudgment, so Dupin thinks that the minister is not hiding the letter. This cycle is described as &amp;ldquo;blind&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sees&amp;rdquo; in the Intersubjectivity chapter of Jacque Lacan&amp;rsquo;s Seminar. One of the three subjects is blind, the second knows that the first is blind and pretends not to see it. The third, on the other hand, realizes that this hiding is essentially exposure, and Lacan refers to these three identities as &amp;ldquo;blind, seer and robber&amp;rdquo; (Müller 60).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we return to &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s short story, it can have another variation. A child playing at home accidentally breaks an expensive vase and becomes very frightened. Suddenly, a witch appears, who waves her wand and fixes the vase. And after the witch leaves, one of the witch&amp;rsquo;s mischievous black cats rushes over and knocks over the vase, and the vase breaks again. The ending of the vase being broken doesn&amp;rsquo;t change in this story. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s just that when the mother comes back and sees the crying child and asks the child what happened, the child tells the mother the story about the witch and the black cat. Although, of course, the mother knows that the so-called witch and the black cat are nothing more than excuses for the child to break the vase, no matter what she says, the child is always in the blind position. If you look at it from this point of view, the child is blind. The child refuses to see the reality of the vase he broke. If the mother gently comforts the child after hearing the story, then the mother is naturally in the seer&amp;rsquo;s position. Yet this is not the reality. Because the child is only using the witch and the black cat as an excuse, he actually knows that those magics do not exist. A lie that no one believes can be so constructed under a premise that is not necessary to explain each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Poe&amp;rsquo;s story, the letters are hidden by the minister by magical means, and once his little trick is recognized, the magic becomes so ridiculous. However, blind and seer are always going to construct a lie together. The one who holds the letter is always blind, and Dupin, eager to see the scene of vengeance, does not give an inch when the minister and the queen themselves confront each other. And the minister produced the letter with Dupin&amp;rsquo;s handwriting on it. This scene, naturally, will not happen for the minister because he is bound &amp;quot; he will consult his cards a final time before laying them down&amp;quot; (Müller 61). And here, as far as Lacan is concerned, it is not the man who possesses the letter, but the letter who possesses the man.&amp;quot; Rather than his possessing the letter, the letter possesses him&amp;quot; (Müller 64). The flow of the letter between subjects rather determines the subject. the one who holds the letter always becomes blind. Magic always prevents those who believe in it from seeing the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The central reason for Lacan&amp;rsquo;s analysis of the story is that he realizes the decisive role of the signifier for the subject. He speaks of &amp;ldquo;the decisive orientation which the subject receives from the itinerary of a signifier&amp;rdquo; (Müller 57). The flow of the letter between subjects thus determines the subject, and whoever holds it or is held by it necessarily becomes blind. However, in the entirety of Poe&amp;rsquo;s story, he makes no mention of what the content of the letter actually is. The content of the letter is never revealed, and it is this that makes Lacan see it as a metaphor. Is the letter a signifier? Or is the letter a metaphor for the signifier? Why is &amp;ldquo;letter&amp;rdquo; a metaphor for &amp;ldquo;signifier&amp;rdquo;? And what is Lacan&amp;rsquo;s signifier?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the linguistic signifier, a signifier is something that characterizes the subject for another signifier. In fact, this sentence does not state any valuable information. If the only function of a signifier is to express a subject for another thing, then there is nothing in a signifier. If in order to express A one needs to refer to signifier B, and in order to understand signifier B one needs to use signifier C, the repetition is endless. This leads to the bizarre conclusion that all signified are signifiers, and the one-to-one correspondence between signifier and signified that Saussure asserted does not exist. If the signifier does not need to be inherently signified in order to characterize the subject for another signifier, then is this the very truth that &lt;em&gt;The Purloined Letter&lt;/em&gt; is a metaphor for. The letter in Poe&amp;rsquo;s story determines those holders of it precisely without the need for its content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s story, &amp;ldquo;magic,&amp;rdquo; as a concept throughout the story, acts as a signifier in the same way as the letter in Poe&amp;rsquo;s story. However, the magic in &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s story is a more violent mode of control over the subject. At the point where the mother lends the hand of the witch to put the candy in the child&amp;rsquo;s pocket, it is the mother who must lend the hand of the witch. The specific form of the magic is secondary to the fact that the magic must exist is primary. Magic as a signifier never needs to point to a specific thing, because it exists in itself in the most false way. But it is this floating signifier that captures both mother and child. They both must sustain the lie in order to legitimize their chain of signifiers. It is the signifier, an empty floating signifier that controls the subject and compels the subject to function under symbolic order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a compulsion, a repetition compulsion, for which the two purposes of the symptom are to replace and to retrieve, and in the story of the witch&amp;rsquo;s candy, the mother, with the help of the Witch, transfers the candy from herself as the subject of the action to the Witch as the subject of the action. She uses the floating magic as a signifier to replace the action, but to retain the action itself. No matter how the magic takes effect, the reality of the matter is always below the curtain, but always presented on the stage. In the case of &lt;em&gt;The Purloined Letter&lt;/em&gt;, the letter itself as a floating signifier essentially contains nothing. So much so that it no longer matters whether the letter itself is a letter or not; rather, the letter must exist. Rather, the letter must exist. the sliding of the signifier allows it to be any signifier, since the signifier itself is not uniquely signified. the signifier&amp;rsquo;s correspondence to the signified is the subject&amp;rsquo;s speech, not a property possessed by the signified itself. Naturally, all those involved in the contest over the letter, whether ministers or Dupin, take the letter to be a signifier beyond the letter, a desire for the supreme phallus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if we revisit &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s story, we can see that there is a hidden layer of narrative in the author&amp;rsquo;s narrative; &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s story is, in short, the annual family meeting of a large family on an isolated island, where they are at each other&amp;rsquo;s throats over the one hundred thousand tons of gold that the oldest of the family&amp;rsquo;s grandfathers has stashed away on the island. The story begins with a fiction writer who claims to have picked up a couple of drift bottles in the middle of publishing a book, and the novel is dominated by the multiple versions of the story of the families fighting amongst themselves on the island recorded in the drift bottles. In fact, even by the end of &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s story, the reader doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what exactly happened on the island that led to everyone&amp;rsquo;s strange deaths. This is similar to Poe&amp;rsquo;s concealment of the contents of the letter. And for its narrative, it repeats itself over and over again. The drift bottle writes multiple versions of the story by repeating real events on the island. The writer of the novel repeats the story of the drift bottle by repeating the story of the drift bottle, and writes additional stories in the writer&amp;rsquo;s mind. &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s repetition refers to the repetition of its narrative. The facts of the island, like the contents of Poe&amp;rsquo;s letter, are completely hidden. However, &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt; has made one small change. The facts of the murders on the island are hidden, but multiple fictional stories adapting the facts of the island are presented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the process of constant repetition, the floating signifier loses itself to the point where it can&amp;rsquo;t stand on its own. In the case of Poe&amp;rsquo;s letter, for example, the letter itself has lost its content in the process of floating. In all the struggles, everyone is not fighting for the letter, but for the letter as a floating signifier, but the letter itself contains no content. Such compulsive repetition forces the subject to repeat the unhappy thing over and over again, even if it is against the principle of pleasure. For example, a child breaks a vase, but tells his mother that the witch has fixed the vase and that the witch&amp;rsquo;s black cat has been a bit naughty. Magic rules this conversation as a signifier. The child&amp;rsquo;s words must be spoken through magic and this process is always forced. The child is compelled to use some form of magic to conceal his or her mistakes, an act that gives him or her an excuse and the mother a reason for comfort. Magic is a regressive possibility for both parties. The witch and the black cat itself, which magic holds behind it as a floating signifier, can be replaced with anything, and thus magic&amp;rsquo;s intrinsic signified is itself a lie, or it, like the letter, does not have a corresponding signified at all. this is a symptom of what it necessarily possesses as a subject of compulsion: the lack and the replace. As mentioned earlier, compulsion necessarily needs to be expressed through replace and retain. The child first deflects itself from the act by concealing it and using magic. By this means the traumatic memories of the wrongful act of breaking the vase are forgotten, and then the effects of this trauma are transferred to other objects. The child is always afraid, and the child&amp;rsquo;s compulsion must be grounded in the fact that he knows that breaking the vase is a morally wrong deed, so he replaces the subject of the behavior as the black cat through the lie of magic. But he always hates the black cat, and he complains that it was the black cat that broke the vase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lack is also an additional action that Dupin does when he switches the letter that the minister has hidden. The minister will inevitably look at the letter before confronting the queen with it to make sure his cards are safe. So the vengeance Dupin expects does not occur. &amp;ldquo;Thus nothing shall [have) happen[ed]-the final turn in Lacan&amp;rsquo;s theater of lack&amp;rdquo; (Müller 64). The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are repetitive, just as a child will continually scream, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the black cat, it&amp;rsquo;s the black cat!&amp;rdquo; Dupin&amp;rsquo;s repetitive nature is also exposed in his bragging, always having to tell the sheriff how clear his thoughts are. But nothing happens. the revenge scene that Dupin expects doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen, and naturally, the witch that the kid expects to apologize for bringing the black cat doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen either. This lack, in turn, leads the subject into the plague of phantasies, and the object of the fantasies, the sexual fantasies of the obsessive-compulsive symptom, is always, in the words of &lt;em&gt;Clinical Lacan&lt;/em&gt;, a &amp;ldquo;nurse&amp;rdquo; (Dor Chpt 16). The nurse is always active, caressing the &amp;ldquo;patient&amp;rdquo; who is passively receiving love in an active way. The compulsion of the compulsion comes from the lack, lacking the phallus, because the fantasy of the compulsion necessarily requires the subject to be the phallus, and this nostalgia is the result of the child&amp;rsquo;s projection of her mother&amp;rsquo;s love for her at an early age.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compulsion is the loss of something and thus the search for a substitute. In the case of Dor&amp;rsquo;s nurse again, the nurse is the substitute for the lack of motherly love. Because of the loss, she wishes to be that phallus of the fantasized mother&amp;rsquo;s love. this kind of compulsion is caused by the decisive effect that the signifier has on the subject in the course of its flow. And the floating signifier and compulsion are hinted at in another story by Edgar Allan Poe, &lt;em&gt;The Black Cat&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;The Black Cat&lt;/em&gt;, the protagonist kills the black cat out of compulsion. And bizarrely, another identical black cat reappears and seduces the protagonist into murdering his wife. And this hateful black cat calls out again to lure the police to bring protagonist to justice. In the novel, the black cat is such a horrible intention. However, the reader has no way of knowing whether the black cat is really a cat or another kind of &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether it is the two types of magic in &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;, or Edgar Allan Poe&amp;rsquo;s letters and the black cat, they all operate as a transcendental signifier. They always point to the name of the father, as in the case of the &amp;ldquo;nurse&amp;rdquo; mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The child necessarily experiences the passage from being to having as problematical because he has been thwarted in his phallic identification with the intruding father. identification with the intruding father&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; In the very place where he would normally come up against frustration, he is the captive of satisfaction in the relationship of supplementation that he maintains with his mother&amp;rdquo; (Dor Chpt 16).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The child develops fantasies about the nurse because he fantasizes about becoming the phallus that his mother loves, but is unable to continue to make out with her after the mirror stage and has to find a similar substitute. And the reason for this is precisely the lack of a father. The father is absent during the Oedipus period of the child, so much so that the child has to be treated as a libido projection of the mother. Because of this, he cannot successfully identify with his father. He cannot commit patricide, and in this emasculated state he is constantly searching for the name of the father, for a &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo;. We can see in &lt;em&gt;The Black Cat&lt;/em&gt; that the black cat constantly haunts the protagonist, and we can see in the mother and the child that the two kinds of magic always constitute their dialog. God didn&amp;rsquo;t die, it just became such transcendent signifier, the big Other, that one keeps repeating and repeating in an empty room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compulsion doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop at the level of subject, but is in fact a situation that is about the effect of the signifier on the person. It is a case of how the master makes the subject enter into such an almost desperate eternal return. such repetitions and compulsive behaviors force the subject to constantly find a solution. Rather, such compulsion is a messianic fantasy of the master. In &lt;em&gt;The Purloined Letter&lt;/em&gt;, whoever wants to have the letter, but the content of the letter is never the point. The minister wants the letter because he sees beyond it. A way to coerce the power of the king and queen by owning the letter. The minister never cared about the content of the letter. Such a purely abstract master signifier is the source of the minister&amp;rsquo;s compulsive behavior. He fantasizes about being in the palace, strategizing and mastering the situation. He fantasizes about being the phallus that his mother loved, the position of supreme power, admired by all. Such fantasies of omnipotence are the very fantasies of his compulsion. Like the minister who thinks that he is getting closer to death in his compulsive behavior, which means that he has been captured by the letter, not that he has captured the letter, the subject of compulsion constantly produces the illusion that &amp;ldquo;God is alive&amp;rdquo;. It is as if the child who broke the vase had gone mad and said, &amp;ldquo;It was the black cat!&amp;rdquo; The slave thus constructs, through repetitive and retrospective actions, the source of his repetitive labor, the slave owner. The superego of the subject of Compulsion is such an internalized God.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compulsion always ends up in one of two ways, a return to a pre-modern state where God is alive, or another pure nihilism. In this category, Nietzsche has found roughly a third solution, one that becomes the Overman, transcending the eternal return. &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s narrative is, in itself, a kind of reincarnation. The playwright of the plot keeps writing the solution to the murder on the island based on the story of the floating bottle, and none of them touches the truth of it. The truth is hidden, and thus the most important part of the cycle is erased, and the infinite number of Eternal Returns is reduced by one. And this most important, absent reincarnation is exactly where God is. God is in a position where he does not exist. And yet, the death drive of all the people in all the stories is precisely to find this reality where God is. &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt; is repeating itself because all the characters in it want to find that solution, that truth. They are trying to grasp the overman in the midst of repetitive and compulsive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this way, difference is revealed precisely in its repetition; repetition is the product of difference, and repetition implies the internalization of all the possibilities of the island, a result that will come to an end no matter what. &lt;em&gt;Umineko&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s narrative, as a parody of &lt;em&gt;And Then There Were None&lt;/em&gt;, is a very different one. None, the narrative has a messianic quality. The end is reached in a constant repetition, the end where everyone on the island dies. But the search for that absence where God is precisely what is fundamentally impossible for Overman, whose repetition is the repetition of the strong, where the certainty of the master can be found in the strong will, that reincarnation where the truth lies. Fantasizing about being the Strongman always results in seeing the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, using an established fact as above, that is, that truth which is hidden, as semiotic order, as a target, breaking through such a return always fails to find the difference completely. For what matters is that since all possibilities written by the playwright are mere possibilities, the key to its repetition lies in its infinity. Eternal Return lies in the infinity of its reincarnation. It should be said that the repetition of compulsive behavior proceeds in a force of self-renewal. The unceasing differentiation is at the same time the unceasing homogenization. Overman does not search for the reality of God&amp;rsquo;s presence in compulsive behavior, but only then that what he sees is no longer mutilated. Completion is an immanence, not a becoming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this way, it is not magic or faith that brings one into the repetitive compulsive behavior, but what one finds in the repetitive compulsive behavior. Not finding a way out of the repetition, but finding the repetition itself to carry on. &amp;ldquo;A letter always reaches its destination&amp;rdquo; (Müller 82). Repetition is not pure; the difference in it should have been revealed in the repetition itself. All the time of that Eternal Return is life and will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-cited&#34; class=&#34;heading-element&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Work Cited&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;#work-cited&#34; class=&#34;heading-mark&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;svg class=&#34;octicon octicon-link&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 16 16&#34; version=&#34;1.1&#34; width=&#34;16&#34; height=&#34;16&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christie, Agatha. &lt;em&gt;And Then There Were None&lt;/em&gt;.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Curd, Patricia. &lt;em&gt;A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia&lt;/em&gt;. Hackett Publishing, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Astrology had a very important place in the theoretical system of these ancient philosophers. Their philosophical ideas, however, were in a state of infantile speculation about natural phenomena during the period of human civilization&amp;rsquo;s exploration of the unknown. Although it is said that the three Milesians were wrong about the world because basic chemistry and physics were not developed at that time, and even mathematics was in an embryonic stage. But that does not mean that there is nothing to learn from their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, say, in subsection 15 on page 18, Hippolytus discusses the physical properties of the earth and the sun, that is, using the physical laws he summarizes for the earth to make derivations for astronomy. Frankly I really didn&amp;rsquo;t get his point in this paragraph, perhaps because my basic knowledge as a modern human being hardly allows me to visualize the astronomical principles he describes. I think it&amp;rsquo;s irrelevant to dwell on whether their knowledge of physics was factually incorrect at all. Why did they form such ideas, why did they think the world consisted of certain elements, why did they think there was some kind of primordial matter (perhaps the same inertia of thought that led to the formulation of the atomic theory or even the theory of the Higgs boson)? What mode of thinking guided them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Philosophy, from its ancient Greek etymology, is love Sophia, the love of wisdom. Here is the phrase: &amp;ldquo;Men who are lovers of wisdom must be inquirers into many things indeed&amp;rdquo; (36, p. 45). It is not that the study of philosophy brings one any didactic ability, eloquent speech or anything (indeed, many people say this about philosophy students). Nor do I think that studying philosophy makes one overman, understand everything, become enlightened. Love to Sophia is about embracing a mode of thinking, a spirit of inquiry. And this spirit is common to the research attitude of positivist science. The study of philosophy necessarily requires the researcher to constantly inquire, to explore. In the constant movement of theories, let theories spiral upward. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect a big Other to suddenly jump out and tell me what the truth of the world is, or that it simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether truth exists or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the chapter on Parmenides, there is a quote that runs through Western philosophy, &amp;quot; . . . for the same thing is for thinking and for being&amp;quot; (3, p. 58). From this, I would argue, the entire lineage of philosophical history up to the post-Critique of Pure Reason era is threaded with this thought. It is (if I may paraphrase) something more than Platonist Idealism, and what it says about the sameness of the two, thinking and being, does not mean that we always have to look to the dichotomy of subject and object. Rather, fundamentally they are the same thing, not two. And the great thing about this statement is that it is necessarily uttered by thinking. Or whether it is uttered by thinking or by being, the latter becomes the former. The process has proven itself. Beautiful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In paragraph 3 on page 102, Anaxagoras brings up the discussion of the small and the large. It reminds me of Heraclitus&amp;rsquo; words on page 45, paragraph 40: &amp;ldquo;It is not possible to step twice into the same river&amp;rdquo;. It touches on the dialectical approach in a metaphysical way. Was thinking about pure formal logic really the secret of the ancient philosophers?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A story like this can be understood in many ways. It can be a conflict between natural law and man-made law, or a conflict between a positivist position and a non-positivist position on the same legal case. Antigone, in jurisprudential terms, stands for natural law, and Creon stands for man-made law. It seems that the story simply discusses the importance of natural law (morality). It seems to be a confrontation between morality and law. But Antigone&amp;rsquo;s story has a certain sublime value in it. The characters in the story have a very unusual emphasis on the definition of womanhood. It&amp;rsquo;s like if I do something weak, if I give in, I become a woman. If I am strong, if I legislate, then I am a man, as Creon puts it: &amp;ldquo;Contemptible character, inferior to a woman&amp;rdquo; (73)! Creon considers a vile character to be an expression of a woman, and he himself, as a man, naturally spurns such behavior. And Ismene similarly says: &amp;ldquo;we must remember that we are women, who cannot fight against men&amp;rdquo; (11). Of course, for historical reasons, Sophocles lived in an Athenian slave-owning democracy, where the right to &amp;ldquo;democracy&amp;rdquo; was only open to a small number of adult males. But why was this so? Women&amp;rsquo;s suffrage was not widely discussed and utilized until the 19th century. Something was at work here. Was it female sexuality? For Antigone, she represented precisely a certain beauty, a certain sublime beauty. as to whether women and female sexuality existed at all, that in itself is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ismene had counseled Antigone against the impulsive behavior that had cost her her life. But Antigone, in her own compulsive repetition, must do it, must do it compulsively. For if she agrees, she becomes one of the products of the ideological narrative. Only when she compulsively says &amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo; she becomes a subject. But why? This compulsion is based on some pure contingency. For example, Kant&amp;rsquo;s high categorical imperative compels her to obey morality, but this abstract morality is fundamentally untenable, and Antigone says that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if her husband dies or her children die. Because one can remarry and reproduce (87). But her brother as a unique signifier, so no. So let us consider who is more unique between the brother and the father and the son? Antigone&amp;rsquo;s explanation is fundamentally so absurd that it is the most absurd grasp of pure chance. And it is precisely in this way that she becomes the opening of subjectivity in the world. For Lacan, Antigone&amp;rsquo;s behavior is precisely a compulsion, a complete, insistent compulsion to fantasize. She believes that the big Other is absent. But is that really the case? Rather, her symptoms become the penetrating force that connects the three Registers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Jacques Lacan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Seminar VII&lt;/em&gt;, he analyzes Antigone&amp;rsquo;s constant assertion that “I chose death” is an embodiment of the death drive. If Antigone is defending her brother&amp;rsquo;s right to be buried on the basis of “absolute disinterestedness”, what order of things obliges her to do so? It is in fact her own action. She does not act for the sake of others, but as the subject of her desire, she acts with complete autonomy. Otherwise, her resistance would have been violently placed as a vulgar disrespect for her true action. For she simply does not believe in a total, underpinning semiotic order, and to recognize the existence of the sublime is to deny Antigone&amp;rsquo;s resistance. Lacan, too, does not deny the existence of Others, and in his Seminar XI he even says: “Man&amp;rsquo;s desire is the desire of the Other”. However, Antigone&amp;rsquo;s true action is precisely what Lacan means by traverse the fantasy, because she is ready to face the cruel fundamental fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for Creon, it is better to say that he is the one most controlled by the order. He did not set the law at all, but the law demanded that he set the law itself. Antigone, who always talks about Zeus, does not seem to recognize the presence of the gods, and Slavoj Žižek, in his book &lt;em&gt;Enjoy Your Symptom!&lt;/em&gt;, even suggests one of Antigone&amp;rsquo;s purest insistence: My brother is my brother, it is what it is. She never explains where it comes from. She insists on her brother&amp;rsquo;s right to be buried in the name of a pure signifier of the law: It is Name. On page 45 of Antigone&amp;rsquo;s original text, in the first paragraph, a long passage of hers confirms that she does not believe that any transcendent order gives Creon power at all. But Creon instead insists that order exists somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Benevolence, morality, law. What foothold does it all have, exactly. To insist that it has some grounding is to establish authority for it. And Antigone, that child who inherited Oedipus&amp;rsquo; will, doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in authority. Everything she does is completely true.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
